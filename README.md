## Enhanced Therapeutic Engagement: A Gamified Arduino Glove System for Hand Rehabilitation

This project investigates the novel combination of gamification and advanced sensor technology to improve hand rehabilitation treatment. The objective of the ”Enhanced Therapeutic Engagement: A Gamified Arduino Glove System for Hand Rehabilitation” is to enhance motivation, involvement, and therapeutic results by converting conventional hand treatment into an engaging and pleasurable experience. The fundamental component of the
system is a glove driven by an Arduino microcontroller. The glove is equipped with inertial measurement units (IMUs), and potentiometers, which accurately record data on fingermotions and hand position.

The glove transmits real-time data to a computer by USB and uses the Unity Engine to analyze it. This allows for smooth engagement with therapeutic games that are specifically intended to address certain rehabilitation objectives. This gamified method tackles typical obstacles in conventional rehabilitation, such as user compliance and tedium, by offering an engaging setting that promotes active engagement. The project’s development included the design of the glove, the creation of custom scripts for data management, and the production of captivating therapeutic activities. The technology enables therapists to track progress,
personalize treatment sessions, and modify game complexity according to individual requirements, guaranteeing a customized rehabilitation program.

This project combines gamification concepts with state-of-the-art sensor technologies, resulting in notable progress in rehabilitation technology. It provides a more captivating, efficient, and pleasurable approach to recovery for those with hand impairments. This strategy not only improves motivation and compliance but also generates useful data for ongoing therapy modification, eventually leading to better treatment results and enhanced quality of life.
